# SVG Parser

This project restores the [SvgParser](http://www.libspark.org/wiki/seven/svgparser) library in libspark's SvgEditor project, using WebArchive, and fixed some issues.

This library implements rendering of SVG images with AS3, but not all features are included.
You can parse Circle, Line, Polyline, Ellipse, Path, Polygon, Rect, Text, Image, ClipPath, Use, etc. Currently only feGaussianBlur and feColorMatrix are available for filter.
